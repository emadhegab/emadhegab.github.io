        <h1>Privacy Policy for Muslim Daily</h1> 

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Muslim Daily! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information when you use our app. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.</p>

        <h2>2. No Account or Login Required</h2>
        <p>Muslim Daily does not require you to create an account or log in to use the app. We do not collect or store any personal information that can directly identify you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>

        <h2>3. Data We Collect for Analytics</h2>
        <p>To improve the appâ€™s functionality and user experience, we collect certain non-personal data for analytics purposes. The information we collect may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use the app, such as the features you interact with, the duration of usage, and the frequency of access.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Information about the device you use to access the app, such as the device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> General location information (e.g., city or country) based on your device's IP address to customize content. Note that we do not collect precise geolocation data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use the Collected Data</h2>
        <p>The data we collect is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To analyze and understand how the app is used.</li>
            <li>To improve the app's features and performance.</li>
            <li>To troubleshoot and fix technical issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Security</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to outside parties. The collected data is used solely for analytics and to enhance the app's performance. We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Analytics Services</h2>
        <p>We may use third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics) to help us analyze how users interact with the app. These services may collect and process data as described in their privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand how they handle your data.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since Muslim Daily does not require a user login or collect personal information that can identify you, there is limited data subject to privacy rights. However, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opt-out of data collection by disabling analytics in the app settings (if applicable) or through your device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
